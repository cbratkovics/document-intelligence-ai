# ADR-0001: Use FastAPI as Web Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a web framework for building the Document Intelligence API that can handle high-throughput document processing, provide excellent performance, and support modern API development practices.

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as our web framework.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Built on Starlette and Pydantic, providing exceptional performance
- **Type Safety**: Native type hints support with automatic validation
- **Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- **Async Support**: Native async/await support for concurrent operations
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support and error messages
- **Standards-based**: Built on open standards (OpenAPI, JSON Schema)

### Negative
- **Maturity**: Relatively newer compared to Django/Flask
- **Ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem of third-party packages
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand async programming

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive documentation and training for team members
- Careful selection of well-maintained dependencies
- Fallback to synchronous handlers where async complexity isn't justified
