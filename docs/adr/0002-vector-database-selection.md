# ADR-0002: Use ChromaDB for Vector Storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Document Intelligence AI requires a vector database for storing and searching document embeddings. The solution must support high-dimensional vectors, provide fast similarity search, and scale to millions of documents.

## Decision
We will use ChromaDB as our primary vector database.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast similarity search with HNSW algorithm
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API with Python-first design
- **Flexibility**: Supports metadata filtering and hybrid search
- **Persistence**: Built-in persistence with multiple backend options
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and growing community

### Negative
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Limited compared to distributed solutions like Milvus
- **Enterprise Features**: Fewer enterprise features than commercial alternatives
- **Query Language**: Less sophisticated than some alternatives

### Mitigation
- Implement caching layer with Redis for frequently accessed vectors
- Plan migration path to distributed solution if scale demands
- Build abstraction layer to allow future database changes

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Pinecone**: Excellent performance but vendor lock-in and cost concerns
2. **Weaviate**: Good features but more complex deployment
3. **Milvus**: Better for massive scale but operational complexity
4. **pgvector**: Simple but limited performance for our use case
