# Health Check Test Fix Summary

## Problem
The health check test in `tests/test_api.py::TestHealthEndpoints::test_health_check` was failing with:
```
AssertionError: assert 'services' in data
```

The test expected a 'services' key but the actual API response uses 'components' instead.

## Root Cause
The health endpoint (`src/api/health.py`) returns a response with this structure:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1754153011,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 0.0,
  "components": {
    "system": {...},
    "models": {...},
    "dependencies": {
      "redis": {...},
      "chromadb": {...}
    }
  },
  "response_time_ms": 57.71
}
```

But the test was checking for `assert "services" in data` which doesn't exist.

## Solution
Updated the test to:
1. Check for 'components' instead of 'services'
2. Validate the nested structure properly
3. Handle cases where external services (Redis, ChromaDB) might be unhealthy in CI
4. Check response structure rather than requiring specific service health
5. Added a test for the `/ready` endpoint which accepts 503 status in CI

## Changes Made

### `tests/test_api.py`
- Fixed `test_health_check` to match actual API response structure
- Added proper validation for components.dependencies
- Made the test CI-friendly by accepting unhealthy dependencies
- Added `test_readiness_check` with proper CI handling

## Test Results
All health endpoint tests now pass:
```
tests/test_api.py::TestHealthEndpoints::test_root_endpoint PASSED
tests/test_api.py::TestHealthEndpoints::test_health_check PASSED
tests/test_api.py::TestHealthEndpoints::test_readiness_check PASSED
```

The fix ensures tests pass in CI environments where external services might not be available while still properly validating the API response structure.
